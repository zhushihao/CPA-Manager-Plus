# Upgrade CPA Manager Plus

This guide explains how to upgrade CPAMP without losing SQLite data, `data.key`, or locally managed secrets. Follow the section for the way CPAMP is currently deployed; do not overwrite an existing deployment with first-install commands.

## Before You Upgrade

1. Read the target [release notes](../reference/releases.md) and the GitHub Release Upgrade Notes.
2. Record the current image tag or native version, launch command, environment variables, and data directory.
3. Stop extra instances that could write to the same SQLite database. Only one Manager Server may consume a CPA usage queue.
4. Back up:
   - `usage.sqlite`, `usage.sqlite-wal`, and `usage.sqlite-shm`.
   - `data.key`.
   - `usage-archives/` when historical archiving has been used.
   - Installer-managed `secrets/`, `.env`, `compose.yaml`, or `config.json`.
   - Custom reverse-proxy, systemd, launchd, or Windows service configuration.

See [Backup And Restore](./backup.md) for safe procedures. A CPA Management Key encrypted in SQLite cannot be recovered if `data.key` is lost.

## What Happens After Startup

- Manager Server applies compatible SQLite schema and metadata migrations automatically; do not run SQL manually.
- Large historical corrections may continue in the background after the HTTP server starts listening.
- Account-history or dashboard-hourly rollups may pause during migration. Related pages temporarily fall back to raw events and can be slower until catch-up completes.
- Do not start a second Manager Server against the same SQLite database or CPA queue to accelerate migration or rollup rebuilds.
- Use authenticated `GET /status` to inspect migration, collector, event, and `databaseMaintenance` state. The global warning, System Info, and Request Monitoring explain when offline maintenance is required.
- The Usage Maintenance page in a Manager Server-hosted panel shows migration, aggregate, active archive, and reclaimable SQLite state. A regular CPA-hosted panel does not show this entry.

### If Database Maintenance Is Degraded

Manager Server binds HTTP before running work whose cost grows with historical data. Missing indexes on populated tables and some legacy-derived cleanup are therefore not executed without a bound during startup. This does not mean data is missing, but historical request queries can become noticeably slower or time out until the query indexes are prepared.

Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose stop cpa-manager-plus

docker compose run --rm --no-deps \
  cpa-manager-plus \
  cleanup-derived --db-path /data/usage.sqlite

docker compose start cpa-manager-plus
```

Native installation:

```bash
cpa-manager-plus cleanup-derived
# Non-default path
cpa-manager-plus cleanup-derived --db-path /path/to/usage.sqlite
```

Stop Manager Server first because the offline command requires the exclusive SQLite process lock. The web UI does not run cleanup automatically, spawn a cleanup subprocess, or create large-table indexes online. The global warning reads bounded metadata through `/status?scope=database-maintenance`, so maintenance polling does not scan or count `usage_events`. After the command completes and Manager Server restarts, `/status.databaseMaintenance` recovers from the real metadata automatically. `cleanup-derived` never deletes, rebuilds, or rewrites authoritative `usage_events`.

## Docker Deployment Created By The Installer

Do not rerun the installer. Enter the original installation directory and update the images:

```bash
cd "$HOME/cpa-manager-plus"
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
```

Replace the path if `CPAMP_INSTALL_DIR` selected another directory.

A full CPA + CPAMP installation pulls both images declared in Compose. To update only CPAMP:

```bash
docker compose pull cpa-manager-plus
docker compose up -d cpa-manager-plus
```

Do not rerun the installer with `CPAMP_OVERWRITE=1` as an upgrade shortcut. That option regenerates configuration and may overwrite maintained `.env`, `compose.yaml`, CPA configuration, or `run.sh` files.

## Manually Maintained Docker Compose

### Tracking `latest`

```bash
docker compose pull cpa-manager-plus
docker compose up -d cpa-manager-plus
docker compose logs --tail=100 cpa-manager-plus
```

### Pinned Version

Change the Compose image to the target version:

```yaml
services:
  cpa-manager-plus:
    image: seakee/cpa-manager-plus:vX.Y.Z
```

Then run:

```bash
docker compose pull cpa-manager-plus
docker compose up -d cpa-manager-plus
```

The corresponding GHCR image is also available:

```text
ghcr.io/seakee/cpa-manager-plus:vX.Y.Z
```

Confirm that the new container mounts the existing `/data` volume or host directory. Do not create a new empty volume for an upgrade.

## Manual `docker run`

Inspect the current ports, volumes, environment, network, and `--add-host` settings first:

```bash
docker inspect cpa-manager-plus
```

Pull the target image and recreate the container. This is a minimal example; retain every option used by the current deployment:

```bash
docker pull seakee/cpa-manager-plus:vX.Y.Z
docker stop cpa-manager-plus
docker rm cpa-manager-plus
docker run -d \
  --name cpa-manager-plus \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 18317:18317 \
  -v cpa-manager-plus-data:/data \
  seakee/cpa-manager-plus:vX.Y.Z
```

If CPA runs on a Linux host, retain:

```text
--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway
```

Removing the old container does not remove a named volume, but removing the volume destroys the data.

## Native Deployment Created By The Installer

The installer normally creates:

```text
runtime/cpa-manager-plus_<version>_<os>_<arch>/
data/
secrets/
run.sh
cpa-manager-plus.service
```

Do not overwrite the running version directory:

1. Stop the current process or systemd service.
2. Back up `data/`, `secrets/`, the old runtime, `run.sh`, and the service file.
3. Download and extract the target release under `runtime/` as a new version directory.
4. Copy `config.json` from the old version directory into the new one. Installer-generated relative paths continue to reference the shared `data/` and `secrets/` directories.
5. Change the working directory and binary path in `run.sh` to the new version directory.
6. If the generated systemd unit is installed, update `WorkingDirectory` and `ExecStart`, then run `systemctl daemon-reload`.
7. Start and verify the new version before deciding whether to remove the old runtime.

Do not copy only `usage.sqlite` and omit WAL/SHM. Back up while the process is stopped or use a safe SQLite method from [Backup And Restore](./backup.md).

## Manual Native Packages

### macOS Or Linux, Foreground Or Control Script

1. Run `./cpa-manager-plusctl stop`, or stop your process supervisor.
2. Back up the data directory and `data.key`.
3. Extract the new package into a new version directory.
4. Continue using the external `USAGE_DATA_DIR` / `USAGE_DB_PATH`, or copy `config.json` and `data/` while the process is stopped.
5. Start with the control script from the new directory:

```bash
./cpa-manager-plusctl start
./cpa-manager-plusctl status
./cpa-manager-plusctl logs
```

Do not extract over a running directory; that can mix binary, control script, and embedded panel versions.

### Linux systemd With A Fixed Program Directory

If the service always launches `/opt/cpa-manager-plus/cpa-manager-plus`:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop cpa-manager-plus
sudo cp -a /var/lib/cpa-manager-plus "/var/lib/cpa-manager-plus.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)"
sudo cp -a cpa-manager-plus_vX.Y.Z_linux_amd64/. /opt/cpa-manager-plus/
sudo systemctl start cpa-manager-plus
sudo systemctl status cpa-manager-plus
```

Keeping `/var/lib/cpa-manager-plus` outside the program directory prevents release files from overwriting runtime data.

### Windows

1. Stop CPAMP through its control script or service manager:

```powershell
.\cpa-manager-plusctl.ps1 stop
```

2. Back up `data`, `config.json`, and service configuration.
3. Extract the new ZIP into a new version directory.
4. Continue using the existing data directory, or copy configuration and data while stopped.
5. Start from the new directory and inspect logs:

```powershell
.\cpa-manager-plusctl.ps1 start
.\cpa-manager-plusctl.ps1 status
.\cpa-manager-plusctl.ps1 logs
```

Update the Windows service configuration if its executable path contains the version directory.

## CPAMP Lightweight Panel

The CPAMP Lightweight Panel is downloaded and hosted by CPA. Updating it changes only the browser frontend; it does not install or update Manager Server, the SQLite schema, or the collector.

Confirm that CPA points to this repository:

```yaml
remote-management:
  panel-github-repository: 'https://github.com/seakee/CPA-Manager-Plus'
```

CPA normally refreshes its cached panel automatically. If it still serves an old panel, remove the cached file from the CPA working directory and reload or restart CPA:

```bash
rm static/management.html
```

When `Disable Panel Auto Updates` is enabled, CPA downloads a panel only when the cached file is absent. Confirm that the file is CPA's panel cache, not Manager Server persistent data, before removing it.

## Custom `management.html` Or `PANEL_PATH`

For a manually deployed single-file panel:

1. Download `management.html` from the target release.
2. Verify it against the release checksum.
3. Keep the old file and atomically replace the static file or the file referenced by `PANEL_PATH`.
4. Clear reverse-proxy and browser caches.

Replacing only `management.html` does not update Manager Server APIs. Mixing a frontend and Manager Server across several releases can cause field or feature incompatibilities; use the panel and Manager Server from the same CPAMP release.

`PANEL_PATH` changes which `management.html` Manager Server serves; the root `/favicon.ico` and `/apple-touch-icon.png` endpoints remain CPAMP service assets. This preserves Safari/iOS compatibility when `PANEL_PATH` points to an official CPAMP Release panel. A third-party panel that needs different branding should use its own explicit icon URLs or embedded icons.

## Verify The Upgrade

Run:

```bash
curl -f http://127.0.0.1:18317/health
curl -f http://127.0.0.1:18317/usage-service/info
curl -f -H "Authorization: Bearer <CPAMP_ADMIN_KEY>" \
  http://127.0.0.1:18317/status
```

Confirm:

- The panel and server report the target version.
- `configured` has the expected value.
- `collector.lastError` is empty or understood.
- `lastConsumedAt`, `lastInsertedAt`, and `eventCount` update normally.
- Dashboard, Request Monitoring, and Usage Analytics load data.
- Usage Maintenance loads recent archive runs and maintenance state. A mismatched old panel or Manager Server should report the feature as unsupported instead of presenting empty data.
- Background migration completes and rollup checkpoints continue advancing in `/status`.
- `/status.databaseMaintenance.required` is `false`. If it is `true`, inspect the deferred-index and offline-job counts and follow the offline steps above.
- Reverse-proxied `/management.html`, `/usage-service/*`, and management API paths still route to the correct service.

For releases involving historical archives or large databases, rehearse on staging: complete backup → reserve temporary free space at least equal to the database-file size → stop every Manager Server → `compact-usage` → start service → check health/status/analytics → decompress an archive sample as documented in [Backup And Restore](./backup.md) and confirm that the source database skips it idempotently → confirm that the same sample is added to an empty isolated recovery instance → restore the complete backup into a separate directory and verify again. Physical compaction is not an automatic upgrade step; run it only after logical deletion when disk space must be reclaimed. Pending derived-data migration checkpoints are preserved by compaction and continue after restart.

## Rollback Principles

- Docker: restore the previous image tag and recreate the container while mounting the pre-upgrade data backup.
- Native: stop the new version and restore the old binary, configuration, and pre-upgrade data backup.
- Single-file panel: restore the previous `management.html`.
- Do not assume an older binary can read a database migrated by a newer version. For schema or data-semantics changes, restore the pre-upgrade SQLite, WAL/SHM, `data.key`, and matching `usage-archives/` together.
- If the cause is unclear, preserve both versions' logs and database copies. Do not repeatedly start different versions against the same live database.
